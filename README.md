# Description:

This repository contains <b><a href="filter.txt">security filter</a></b> for <b><a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home.html">AdGuard Home</a></b> that blocks:
- Spyware, malware and ransomware domains and their subdomains🤬
- Phishing, fraud, fake and scam hosts and their subdomains💩

This filter is a compilation from different <b><a href="configuration.json">sources</a></b> at the request of <b><a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler">HostlistCompiler</a></b>📡You can use it any way you want, but I recommend using it with the desktop versions of <b><a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-mac/overview.html">AdGuard</a></b>🛡The file will be updated regularly⚠️

## Note:

My filter is optimized for use <b>ONLY</b> in <b><a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome">AdGuard Home</a></b>🛸Please do not convert it to hosts, dnsmasq, BIND, Squid or RPZ syntaxes⛔️Feel free to <b><a href="mailto:contact@ammnt.app">contact me</a></b> with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blocked🙋🏻‍♂️
